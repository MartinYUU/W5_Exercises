# Create two variables for dollars and cents:
# ∗ dollars should contain a value of 3 dollars
# ∗ cents should contain a value of 50 cents
# ∗ Test your variables by running: print(dollars + cents)
# If you get an incorrect result, adjust your variables and try again.
# 8. BONUS: Create a piece of code with the strings '3 dollars' and 'fifty cents',
# then combine them in a print statement that yields the text output 3 dollars fifty cents


dollars = 3
cents = .50
print(dollars + cents)

sdollar = '3 dollars'
scents =  'fifty cents'
print(sdollar + ' ' + scents)
