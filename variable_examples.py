# Lab 1
# Create example variables with good names to represent the following items (make up a
# sample value for each variable to contain):
# ∗ Customer ID
# ∗ Customer’s first, middle, and last name
# ∗ Gender
# ∗ Date of birth
# ∗ Driver’s license number
# ∗ Auto policy number
# ∗ NOTE: Recall that you can create an empty string variable by setting the value to ' '
# or a number variable with an initial value of 0
# 3. Regarding the variables you creates, what assumptions did you make about the type of
# value that the variable might need to contain? Make a note after the variable as an
# inline code comment, starting with #.
# 4. Create variables for your own name and the city and state where you were born


#made everything a string because there should not be any mathematical operations performed on these values
customerID = '644381'
firstName = 'Natalie'
middleName = 'Alisson'
lastName = 'Reyes'
gender = 'Female'
birthDate = '03/15/2005'
driverLicenseNumber = '164862591475'
autoPolicyNumber = '116629713486'

birthName = 'Martin Reyes'
birthCity = 'Cuenavaca'
birthState = 'Morelos'

# Pick 5 of these words and review the explanation for how it is used as a keyword in
# Python. Add these 5 definitions as comments to your exercise document. Put ^^
# around any terms that you are not familiar with


# raise
# The raise statement is used to raise an error. These errors are visible
# in the traceback and they cancel the execution of the program if not handled properly.

# None
# There is no null value in Python. The None is an object that represents the 
# absence of a value. It is like an empty object.

# try
# The try statement is used to make a try… except statement. The try statement 
# starts a block of code that is tried to execute. If it fails, the except block catches the error.

# lambda
# A lambda function in Python is an anonymous function. It can take any number
# of arguments but only have a single expression.

# break
# It is a control flow statement used to come out of a loop.
