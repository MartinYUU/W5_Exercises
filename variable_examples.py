# Create example variables with good names to represent the following items (make up a
# sample value for each variable to contain):
# ∗ Customer ID
# ∗ Customer’s first, middle, and last name
# ∗ Gender
# ∗ Date of birth
# ∗ Driver’s license number
# ∗ Auto policy number
# ∗ NOTE: Recall that you can create an empty string variable by setting the value to ' '
# or a number variable with an initial value of 0
# 3. Regarding the variables you creates, what assumptions did you make about the type of
# value that the variable might need to contain? Make a note after the variable as an
# inline code comment, starting with #.
# 4. Create variables for your own name and the city and state where you were born


#made everything a string because there should not be any mathematical operations performed on these values
